    <h1>Yogyakarta, the city of art and culture</h1>
        <h2>The Heart of Yogyakarta </h2>
            <p>Yogyakarta, the city of arts & culture. It’s the city known for many other things, such as being the only Indonesian royal city that is still being ruled by a monarchy. I never got the chance to talk about it, but since I’ve recently went on a study tour— I got the opportunity to learn & understand more about the history, arts, and culture in Yogyakarta, and I’ll be sharing my newfound knowledge and experiences. But before that, I want to share the answers to the questions I had before going on to Yogyakarta. It’s known as the city of arts & culture due to its rich heritage & vibrant culture. It was founded by Pangeran Mangkubumi in 1755. Until now, everyone can see the culture alive and well, but modernization still affects the culture by impacting traditions, social interactions, and the way people interact.</p>
        <h2>Why do the Arts & Culture Matter so Much in Yogyakarta? </h2>
            <p>You're probably thinking, “what makes the art & culture in Yogyakarta so special or different?” Well, it has its own history behind it, and it stands out because of its strong connections to royal history as well as its connections to the blend of Hindu - Buddhist and Islamic influences, which is why cultural preservation is so encouraged in Yogyakarta. Aside from that, the arts & culture is underrated and has special value. It’s often described as unique, gorgeous, and deeply spiritual. From traditional batik-making, gamelan music, and shadow puppetry, to contemporary street art and performances, Yogyakarta is a living museum that constantly balances the old and the new. You’ll find artists working in workshops just steps away from modern galleries, all thriving in the same creative energy.</p>
        <h2>Art as a Way of Life</h2>
            <p>One of the most eye-opening parts of my visit was learning how strongly the local community supports its heritage. Art is not just something to admire— it’s something they live. Schools teach local dances, families pass down traditional crafts, and public spaces often become stages for cultural expression. It was inspiring to see how the city breathes life into its history every single day.</p>
            <p>To sum it up, Yogyakarta isn’t just a city with culture. It is culture. It’s a place that taught me the importance of preserving identity in a changing world, and how art can be both a mirror of the past and a voice for the future.</p>
